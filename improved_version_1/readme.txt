This folder contains the improved project of tomato clock 

Improved functions: 
  1. The push button at PC1 has different function now. When pressed, it re-starts the program and starts with a different time counting down. If previously 
     is 25mins setting, pressing PC1 button changes it to 45mins and vice versa. Two options only. 
  2. Switch debouncing of PC1 implemented using TIMER0 and its interrupt.
